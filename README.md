## Introduction

The Algorithm Visualizer project is designed to help users grasp the inner workings of sorting and searching algorithms through interactive visualizations. With easy-to-follow animations and explanations, you can observe how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Linear Search, and Binary Search operate in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize sorting and searching algorithms step by step.
- Choose different array sizes for algorithms.
- Adjust visualization speed to observe details at your pace.
- Clearly understand how data gets manipulated during algorithm execution.

## Algorithms

This project currently supports the following algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Each algorithm visualization includes explanations of the algorithm's logic and the step-by-step progression, making it an ideal educational resource for learners.
